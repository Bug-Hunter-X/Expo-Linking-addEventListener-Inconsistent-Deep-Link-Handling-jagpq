This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` method doesn't always trigger when a deep link is opened, particularly when the app is already running in the background. This inconsistency can lead to missed deep links and unexpected behavior.  The provided code demonstrates this issue.  A deep link should trigger the `handleOpenURL` function and print the URL to the console, but this doesn't reliably happen.
