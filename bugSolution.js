While a complete fix for the core issue within the Expo Linking API might require updates from the Expo team, several workarounds can improve reliability.

**Workaround 1: Using `Linking.getInitialURL`**
This method retrieves the initial URL when the app launches and can catch deep links opened even if `Linking.addEventListener` missed them.
```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

useEffect(() => {
  const getInitialUrl = async () => {
    const initialUrl = await Linking.getInitialURL();
    if (initialUrl) {
      handleOpenURL(initialUrl);
    }
  };
  getInitialUrl();
}, []);
```
**Workaround 2:  Implementing a Background Task (More Complex)**
For more persistent background handling, you may need to implement a background task or service using platform-specific mechanisms (e.g., Headless JS in React Native). This involves registering for push notifications or creating a background service which maintains a persistent connection and listens for deep links independently of the main app's lifecycle. This approach is significantly more involved and requires a deeper understanding of native mobile development. 
**Workaround 3: Consider Alternative Deep Linking Solutions**
Explore alternatives like Firebase Dynamic Links, which are built to handle deep links even when the app is closed. This is often the most reliable option for critical deep link functionalities.
